# Embedded IoT Projects

This repository contains weekly assignments and tasks completed as part of the **Embedded Systems & IoT** course.  
Each week introduces new microcontroller programming concepts using PlatformIO and C++, such as GPIO/button control, timers/interrupts, PWM/buzzer, and sensor interfacing.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Platform & Build

All projects are developed using **PlatformIO** (embedded development environment) and the Arduino framework.  

To build and upload a project (inside each folder):  
```bash
platformio run
platformio run --target upload
```

## üß† Learning Outcomes
- GPIO and button control

- Timer interrupts and debouncing

- PWM signals and buzzer control

- Sensor interfacing (temperature, LDR)

- Integrating multiple peripherals into combined systems
