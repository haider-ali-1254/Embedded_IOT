---

A trivial starter sketch that turns one LED on continuously. Useful to verify wiring and board functionality before moving to more complex exercises.

## Components
- ESP32 development board
- LED (external) or on-board LED

## Wiring / Pinout
| Signal | Board pin |
|---|---:|
| LED | Check `src/main.cpp` (default configured pin) |

## Quick start (PlatformIO)
Build and upload:

```
platformio run --target upload
```

## Notes
- This project is intentionally minimal — use it to confirm a working LED and board setup.

See `src/main.cpp` for the exact pin used and implementation.
